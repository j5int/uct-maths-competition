<p>
Membership of the UCT Maths Circle is by invitation only. The top 10% of individuals and top 3 pairs in each grade of the UCT Mathematics Competition are invited in May every year to join the UCT Maths Circle. Further invites are usually sent in July to those who made it through to the third round of the South African Mathematics Olympiad. Schools have also been sent a special invitation, in the beginning of the year, to nominate two grade 8's and two grade 9's to join the UCT Maths Circle. Other special invitations are also sent out from time to time.
</p>	

<p>
Membership of the UCT Maths Circle isn't permanent and is also not a right, but only a privilege granted because of past performance. Therefore if you do not perform according to certain standards or are disruptive in class your Maths Circle membership might be suspended and you might not be reinvited the next year.
</p>

<p>
If you are in grade 8 or 9 and haven't been invited, but really want to join you may attempt the following two problem sets:
<ul>
	<li><a href=private/documents/beginner.pdf>UCT Maths Circle Beginner Series</a><br>
	<li><a href=private/documents/intermediate.pdf>UCT Maths Circle Intermediate Series</a>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Your attempts can be posted to:
</p>
<p>
UCT Maths Circle<br>
Department of Mathematics and Applied Mathematics<br>
University of Cape Town<br>
Rondebosch<br>
