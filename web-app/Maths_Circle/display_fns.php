The follow should be read before attempting the Camp Selection Test:
<ul>
	<li>Under "Getting Started": Proofs<br>
	<li>Under "Tier 1": Both Tiling Chapters<br>
	<li>Under "Tier 1": All the Number Theory Chapters<br>
	<li>Under "2007 Notes": Lecture Notes: Writing up Solutions<br>
	<li>Under "2007 Notes": Reading: Important Theory and Exampls<br>
	<li>Under "2007 Notes": Reading: Factorization<br>
	<li>Under "2007 Notes": A: Solving BAMO Problems<br>
	<li>Under "2007 Notes": C: Proofs<br>
	<li>Under "2007 Notes": E: Exploring Pascal's Triangle<br>
	<li>Under "2007 Notes": G: Counting and Combinatorics<br>
	<li>Under "2007 Notes": H: Diophantine Equations<br>
	<li>Under "2007 Notes": M: Geometry Theorems<br>
	<li>Under "2007 Notes": O: Mathematical Induction<br>
	<li>Under "2007 Notes": S: Inequalities<br>
	<li><a href=documents/NumberTheory_OddsAndEnds_Eng.pdf>Number Theory Odds and Ends</a>
</ul>
<br>
These should cover almost all of the questions. However the new notes that I put up do not contain questions by themselves and I will still improve the notes and add more notes, but at least these should be sufficient to get the Camp SDelection Test done. After you completed the Camp Selection Test you can start on the "Tier 1" Notes again.
</b>
</p>

<p>
<b>
As I said I won't give explicit help with the Camp Selection Test. The above references should be quite a lot already. However, I may explain some concepts in the notes. Furthermore, for Section A of the Camp Selection Test I am prepared to check the final numerical value. Thus you can ask via the "Tutor" function whether a certain numerical answer for a question in section A is correct or not. I will only confirm whether it is correct or incorrect, but I won't explain why.
</b>
</p>

<p>
<b>
Please note that all the Junior and Senior Rankings were removed. If you want to see rankings more related to the Stellenbosch Camp please visit my private website ATMOSA. If you don't have access to it and are trying to make the Camp you can contact me and I will send you the details of my private website.

<p>

The Stellenbosch Camp has been provisionally scheduled for the dates Sunday 7 December to Friday 12 December. I am mainly responsible for selecting the Stellenbosch Campers. Hence, if you want to be selected for the camp you must impress me. Firstly the most important part is the Camp Selection Test which was handed out on 17 September. If you do well in it your chances of getting an invited is quite good. In addition to the Camp Selection Test I will still look at other results from the past year. That being SAMO, IPMO, UCT Invitational as well as the actual handins from the Notes under IMO Preparation. The way to impress me is by doing a lot of handins. And the way to do a lot of handins is by making time for it and asking me for help if you are stuck.
</b>
</p>
	
<p>
<b>
How to do well in the Camp Selection Test:<br>
Most of the questions in the Camp Selection Test will be covered by Notes under the "IPMO Preparation" or under "2007 Notes" which is under "2007 Rankings". I am still in the process of typing more Notes and I hope to have some more out by Wednesday 24 September. Thus you will probably not be able to solve all the questions in Section A and B yet, however I hope that by Friday I will have enough notes out so that you will. Some notes which are still to come and you might need to solve the questions in the Camp Selection Tests are Number Theory Chapters 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7; Pigeon Hole Principle Chapters 1 and 2; Mathematical Induction Chapter 1; Inequalities Chapters 1, 2 and 3. Thus be on the lookout for these chapters. 
</b>
</p>

<p>
<b>
I won't help you directly with the Camp Selection Test, however I will still help you with the Notes. So you may use the "Tutor" function for this.

As you will see I have finished marking everything I have with me. If you want to find out about your marks or what was wrong, just use the "Tutor" page to ask what you got wrong and what you need to redo. I will be available for tutoring this whole weekend. Yes, even on Sunday. And even until 23:00. If I don't respond immediately, just wait about 10 minutes and I should be available by then. If the system crashes just sign in and open it up again.
</p>
	
<p>
Try to have submitted all you can on the Beginner and Intermediate Series by Saturday 30 August, since after Saturday 30 August you won't have any time for these as the Online MCQs will become available then. And remember the "Tutor" function can be used. Don't feel guilty to use it. Since if everyone uses it there can be nothing to feel guilty about. Furthermore, the first step in improving is realizing that you need help.
</p>
	
<p>
Remember the selection tests will be on Saturday 30 August and Saturday 6 September. The details are on the "Schedule" page. If you are not sure where you need to be ask me to find out. If some of you have been signed up through your school for the UCT Maths Series on these days, it is fine since our selection tests forms part of the UCT Maths Series.

Just to point out. I am mainly responsible for selecting the Stellenbosch Campers going to the camp in the first week of December. Hence, if you want to be selected for the camp you must impress me. The way to impress me is by doing a lot of handins. And the way to do a lot of handins is by making time for it and asking me for help if you are stuck.

<p>
I want to congratulate the Seniors with showing an utter lack of work ethic. Very nice Seniors.  (PS: Greg, this does not apply to you.)
</p>
	
<p>
<b>
If you are stuck on any of the problems and required help there is a "Tutor" function on the website and you can make use of this facility to ask me questions directly online. So you don't have an excuse that it was too dificult, since I am available for help. So Juniors, if you are stuck on the Intermediate Series ask me for hints. Don't be to scared to ask.

<p>
After each Wednesday's Maths Circle session I will mark the submitted solutions to the homework and exercises in the notes. Each week the Junior and the Senior who get the most marks for that week's batch of submissions, will be reflected in the table on the "Weekly Performers" page. Thus any new submissions I receive from this point on until Wednesday 16 July will count towards the total for the week of 16 July. Please note that this will probably show who is willing to put in the most effort (thus you need not necessarily be the brightest in the Maths Circle to be able to win the distinction of "Performance of the Week").
</p>


<p>Since the Pre-IMO Camp is from 7 to 11 July, I will be unavailable. Hence any solutions or emails sent to me will only be dealt with after 11 July.</p>

<p>
Uploaded new file. There are two Chapters on Tiling available under "Tier 1". Furthermore "Getting Started" contains some chapters on Proofs.
</p>
	
	<p>If you are new to the UCT Maths Circle, please read the information under the "International Maths Olympiad - Preparation" given on the page "Camps and IMO" and then fill in the questionnaire.
	</p>

	<p>There is a questionnaire available and I will appreciate it if you fill it in and submit it.
	</p>

	<p>
		The assignments and work are divided into two main sections. The section which is necessary for IPMO Selection and the section which isn't needed for IPMO Selection, but those interested can go through.

			All the Notes and questions are now on the site. There are in total 250 questions which can be submit giving a grand total of 2500. Obviously the questions vary in difficulty. Hence it would be impossible to get near the 2500 before the camp. However we will see if anyone will win the following titles:<br>
			First to 1000<br>
			First to 1500<br>
			First to 2000<br>

			The WP Teams must arrive at 13:30 at the Department of Mathematics on the UCT Upper Campus (normal Wednesday venue). The IPMO will start at 14:00 with the hour Individual paper. Thereafter a 30 minute refreshment break follows. From 15:30 to 16:30 the teams write the one hour team paper, which only requires you to solve the problems and submit as a team numerical solutions to the questions. No proofs are required, just answers. The team members should work together to solve as many of the 10 problems as they can within the allotted time. Thereafter we wait for all the Provinces results to be sent to us.

		Team places for the IPMO will not go automatically to those who attended some Maths Circle sessions. You will need to submit problems/homework. The grade 8's and 9's who have been invited, because they are through to the SAMO third round should at least just attempt the Online MCQ section and some Beginner and Intermediate Series since this will be most relevant to the third round. However, be warned, if you haven't submitted a single attempt (only attempts count and not marks) to any of the homework and the MCQ's online, you will NOT be selected as part of an IPMO team. This is mainly of importance to grades 10, 11 and 12 who haven't submitted anything or only submitted very few attempts. I will decide whether you are committed enough to deserve a place in the WP IPMO teams. If in doubt ask me.

		I will be available on Saturdays 1 and 8 September from 09:00 to 13:00 at the Department of Mathematics.

I will be going down to Kramer Law Building at 13:00 and will therefore be available from 13:15 at the Kramer Law Building Lecture Theatre 2. Anyone is welcome to come ask for help between these times. It is also quite acceptable if you want to come through from 09:00, 10:00 or 11:00 and then stay until 18:00 (for those keen enough). If you plan to use these available times, please let me know so that I can expect you. Otherwise it is fine to also just pitch up on the day if you suddenly decide you want more help, since I will be available.

		The lectures on Wednesdays have ended, so all Notes have been handed out. All relevant questions to submit has therefore also been handed out, however I am still to upload more MCQ's online for online participation. The WEDNESDAY SESSIONS DO CONTINUE, but from now on it will be tutorial style. Therefore you should bring all the notes as well as your attempts (and those completed) with. You should also make a list of the problems you have. There will be more coaches in the venue and thus you will be expected to ask questions on the work you do not understand yet. Furthermore, if you don't have specific questions you should still attend, but solve and write up solutions to the problems and when stuck you will be able to ask the coaches for help.

	<b>
	For those of you who is through to the Junior SAMO Third round, the Beginner and Intermediate Series will be excellent preparation as the third round requires fully written solutions and is not MCQ. The past three papers can be downloaded from </b><a href=http://www.samf.ac.za/samo/questions.html>SAMO Papers</a><b>. The beginner and Intermediate Series serves the double purpose of giving preparation for SAMO and also helping your ranking towards the IPMO team selection.
	</b>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	<b>
		The last day to submit work, which is aimed towards your ranking for IPMO team selection, is Saturday 8 September. There are less than 3 weeks to go. So please try to submit quite a lot in the little time left. Solutions to the "Notes" can still be submitted after 8 September, but it will count towards Stellenbosch Camp selection and not towards the IPMO, since I will announce the teams on Wednesday 12 September.
	</b>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	I have also now added information on the Stellenbosch Camp and IMO (underneath Notes' rankings) for those who might be interested in continuing on to higher levels of participation.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	I have updated the "Marks" section and you are now able to view your mark for each MCQ so that you can see where your mistakes were.<br>
	Please check which questions you got wrong and retry them. If you still not sure about why you got it wrong please ask me.

The table only mentions the winners in the Junior and Senior section, since some interesting information therefore gets lost, I want to point it out here.<br>
Juniors:<br>
Sean Wentzel - Grade 9 had a score of 308<br>
Ashraf Moolla - Grade 9 had a score of 264<br>
Rhoni Gericke - Grade 8 had a score of 207<br>
Both Sean and Ashraf went to the March Camp in Bloemfontein consisting of 11 campers. This camp was the selection camp for the IMO and PAMO Teams. Hence for the Juniors who are interested in trying out for the IMO/PAMO teams, the goal is to try and beat them or get as close as possible to them.<br>
<br>
Seniors:<br>
Greg Jackson - Grade 10 had a score of 540<br>
John Nicholas - Grade 11 had a score of 263

function ipmo_selection()
{

	<h2 align="center"> IPMO Selection </h2> 

	<p>
		As we stated before everyone who attends the UCT Maths Circle sessions regularly on Wednesday afternoons and those who can't attend but do the required homework on the website through the website/email/post/friend will be included in the the WP IPMO Teams. There are a Junior (grade 8, 9) and Senior (grade 10, 11, 12) section. Each team consists out of 10 individuals. Thus to select who is in which team the following will be used:
	<ul>
		<li>Selection Tests<br>
		<li>Homework<br>
		<li>Invitational Challenge results
	</ul>
	</p>

	<p>
		There will be 3 selection tests. One on Wednesday 16 July and the other two on the two Saturdays before the IPMO. The purpose of 3 selection tests is so that if someone can't attend one then it isn't a big problem, since there are still two others. Furthermore, since the Invitational Challenge and Homework marks will come into play as well there is enough places to make up for missed selection tests.
	</p>

	<p>
		Homework will consist out of online MCQ papers to be submitted as well as question sets where questions must be answered by full solutions and submitted. The Homework necessary for IPMO Selection is given on the page "Homework". These questions must be attempted to be considered for selection. Thus you will need to attempt the questions which falls under the "IPMO 2008" heading.
	</p>

	<p>
   You are not required to do the questions under the "International Maths Olympiad - Preparation" to be selected for the WP IPMO Teams, since these questions are primarily for those who want to stand a stance of being selected for the team to represent South African at the International Mathematics Olympiad (IMO). However, although it is not a requirement for IPMO selection, when selecting who is in which team extra credit will go to those who attempted questions from this section as well.

function homework()

	<h2 align="center"> Homework </h2> 

	<p>
		The UCT Maths Circle doesn't just function on the weekly classes, but on homework as well. Since everyone has different priorities and a different amount of time to spend on extra maths during the week, everyone can work through the homework on their own time. However the homework on this page must be attempted to be selected into a WP team.
	</p>

	<p>
		The current available homework exercises which can be done and submitted are:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li><a href=documents/beginner.pdf>UCT Maths Circle Beginner Series</a><br>
		<li><a href=documents/intermediate.pdf>UCT Maths Circle Intermediate Series</a>
	</ul>

	<p>
		The solutions to these can either be submitted at the Maths Circle sessions (given to Phil), emailed or posted.
	</p>

	<p> For space and size purposes, if you want to email the scanned or typed solutions please use the email address phil.labuschagne@gmail.com and not the UCT one.

	<h3 align="center"> Comments or corrections to Notes </h3> 
	
	<h4 align="center"> A: Solving BAMO Problems </h4> 

	<p>
		Sections 2, 3 and 4 should be read through and you should keep these in mind when trying to solve and write up full solutions to problems.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Questions to concentrate on in Section 5: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 15<br>
		Ignore the other questions in Section 5 unless you specifically know what is going on with them because they are very difficult. All questions can be submitted for marks.
	</p>
	
	<h4 align="center"> B: Mathematical Games </h4> 

	<p>
		There is a mistake in question 19. The move should be to take integer powers of 2, less than or equal to the current number.
	</p>

	<p>
		Concentrate on: 1, 2, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, however all question can be submitted for marks.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The following questions can be generalized: 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20
	</p>

	<p>
		The following questions are rather difficult to solve completely: 5, 6, 11, 19, 20
	</p>

	<h4 align="center"> C: Proofs </h4> 

	<p>
		Another reading to demonstrate how to write up proofs.
	</p>

	<h4 align="center"> D: A Haloween Contest </h4> 

	<p>
		Problems 2, 3, 5, 7 shouldn't be that difficult, but first try the problems from A and B. All questions can be submitted for marks.
	</p>
	
	<h4 align="center"> E: Exploring Pascal's Triangle</h4> 

	<p>
		Lecture notes for 18 and 21 July. It is preferable that you read through this beforehand. However it will be thoroughly discussed in class, however if you have gone through it beforehand it will be easier to follow and you will learn more this way.
	</p>

	<h4 align="center"> F: Combinatorics Problems </h4> 

	<p>
		All the question which doesn't have a solution on the page can be submitted for marks. However, the juniors will quite possibly get stuck on the questions from the second page onwards.
	</p>

	<h4 align="center"> G: Counting and Combinatorics </h4> 

	<p>
		This is important since there are bits of theory in between which should be read through. They also solve some of the questions so that you can see how to do them. The answers from 22 onwards is available online at the site they reference. These are therefore left as a self-exercise.
	</p>

	<h4 align="center"> H: Diophantine Equations </h4> 

	<p>
		This is an important reading enabling you to reduce fractions, solve some linear equations and find greatest common divisors.
	</p>

	<h4 align="center"> I: Problems on Diophantine Equations </h4> 

	<p>
		Problems 1(a), 1(b) and 1(c) should be submitted.<br>
		The Seniors might benefit by attempting 1(d), 1(e), 2 and 3 as well.<br>
		Please ignore problems 4 and 5 as it deals with theory which is not covered by the Maths Circle sessions.
	</p>

	<h4 align="center"> J: Euler's Theorem </h4> 

	<p>
		This is an important reading using tools which are important when working with solids.
	</p>

	<h4 align="center"> K: Problems on Graph Theory </h4> 

	<p>
		This is a set of questions on Graph Theory. The earlier questions are easier, but the last questions are hard.
	</p>

	<h4 align="center"> L: More Problems on Games </h4> 

	<p>
		This has more Mathematical Game questions and most questions should be easy enough to do.
	</p>

	<p>
		Question 8 - The person who cannot move loses. Which player wins and how?<br>
		Question 10 - You may still move and create a closed path. You may not move if the closed path has been created in the previous move.
	</p>
	
	<h4 align="center"> M: Geometry Theorems</h4> 

	<p>
		This is an important reading on Geometry. The juniors must just skip over the sections which mentions "sin" and "cos".
	</p>

	<h4 align="center"> N: Fractions</h4> 

	<p>
		This is an important reading on Fractions. Don't let the name fool you, it isn't as easy as the name suggests. Please read through it completely.
	</p>

	<p>
		Typing Mistake: Page 15 - Second last paragraph - the "all mod n" should be "all mod 10".
	</p>
	
	<h4 align="center"> O: Mathematical Induction</h4> 

	<p>
		This is an important reading on the Principle of Mathematical Induction - a method of proof. It also includes some problems and solutions so that you can see how to to induction questions.
	</p>

	<h4 align="center"> P: Mathematical Induction - Problems</h4> 

	<p>
		This is just a set of problems which can be submitted towards the rankings. Recommended problems: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 11, 15
	</p>

	<h4 align="center"> Q: Pigeon-Hole Principle - Problems</h4> 

	<p>
		This is just a set of problems which can be submitted towards the rankings. Recommended problems: 1 to 14<br>
		Question 2 - You can assume that there are more than 35 in the Maths Circle.<br>
		Question 3 - Common divisor greater than 1.<br>
		Question 15 to 22 - Be careful with respect to the trivial solutions. Remember to also include them if necessary.
	</p>

	<h4 align="center"> R: More problems on Graph Theory</h4> 

	<p>
		This is just a set of problems which can be submitted towards the rankings. Recommended problems: 1 to 14
	</p>

	<p>
		Question 8 - The two sketches they refer to isn't really necessary for the question. It was just to show what a bipartite graph looks like.<br>
		Question 9 - The bit about always being able to declare a winner is a bit misleading, so ignore it.<br>
		Question 17 - Again the sketch is missing but not necessary to answer the question.
	</p>

	<h4 align="center"> S: Inequalities</h4> 

	<p>
		This is a reading introducing imporatant new theory. There are also some problems on it at the end.
	</p>

	<p>
		Mistake: Top of Page 5 - The formula P_r isn't a fraction and should not have the divides by n. Hence the denominator is actually 1 and not n.
	</p>
	
	<h4 align="center"> T: Miscellaneous Problems - BAMO Preparation</h4> 

	<p>
		This is just a set of problems which can be submitted towards the rankings.
	</p>

	<p>
		Typing Mistake: Question 3 - The A2006 should actually read A subscript 2006.
	</p>
