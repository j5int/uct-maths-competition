<p>
The UCT Mathematical Circle is an outreach programme for high school students (in the Cape Town area) who show particular ability and interest in mathematics. The Maths Circle concentrates on developing problem-solving skills, unlike schools where the focus is on solving routine-type questions. The Maths Circle emphasizes understanding mathematical concepts rather than pure memorization of formulae. It furthermore covers enrichment material which is not in the school curriculum and aims to improve our competitiveness internationally.
</p>	

<p>
The teaching paradigm differs from that of schools and it is hoped that this shift in paradigm might shed more light on the beauty and the underlying concepts of mathematics. It usually takes a bit of time for new members to adjust to this paradigm shift, but once adjusted, this new paradigm of problem-solving will bring enjoyment and improve performance in a number of mathematical competitions and olympiads.
</p>

<p>
It is strongly advised for those joining the UCT Maths Circle to:
<ul>
<li>Attend the classes every week.<br>
<li>Take part in discussions.<br>
<li>Do homework and devote a couple of hours a week to reading and the study of topics covered in the weekly sessions.<br>
<li>Subscribe to the Mathematical Digest.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Please note that the UCT Maths Circle is NOT:
<ul>
	<li>A school maths revision or remedial programme.<br>
	<li>A substitute for any part of the normal school maths programme.<br>
	<li>A bridging course in preparation for university mathematics.<br>
	<li>A programme of acceleration as the mathematics discussed will come from outside the school curriculum.
</ul>
