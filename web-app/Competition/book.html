<p>
Mathematics is not a spectator sport! The benefit of the Competition for participants is greatly enhanced by training and preparation. Schools which take some trouble in selecting their teams and encourage participants to work through competition papers from previous years, always achieve better results in the Competition. A variety of training material is available:
