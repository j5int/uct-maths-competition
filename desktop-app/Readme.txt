---Item Analysis---

This program produces TEX output from the Maths Competition Item Analysis Files.

For each grade, it combines the Individual and Pair item analysis files 
into a single table in a TEX file.

This program consists of the following files:
 ItemAnalysis.exe     - performs the conversion for a single grade
 ItemAnalysis.C       - C program which was compiled to produce Itemanal.exe
 RunMe.bat            - calls ItemAnalysis.exe with the correct parameters for each grade.

You should use the program RunMe.bat

Input files: 
  Place the files INDGR8.ITM, PRGR8.ITM, ... INDGR12.ITM, PRGR12.ITM in the same
  directory as the program RunMe.bat and Itemanal.exe.  

Output files:
  The output will be placed in the files ALLGR8.ITM, ... ALLGR12.ITM

Alternatively you can edit the file RunMe.bat to change these default file names, 
but this is not recommended.
